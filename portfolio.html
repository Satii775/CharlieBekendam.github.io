                            inside a cessna and learn how to fly. I was the main 3D developer, video editor, and did
                            some UI. It was fun to work in a group and be able to do 3D modeling and get more experience

                        <h1>Fly Tying Simulator</h1>
                        <p>This is a game that I am working on for my final capstone game. At the end, the entire thing
                            will be made by me. So far, I have made a prototype, utilizing some game mechanics
                            I hope to use in the final version, and made some 3D models to simulate what I want the end
                            product to look like.
                            I practiced my coding techniques by making the code more modular to be used by multiple
                            objects,
                            and I practiced more with 3D modeling. It has been fun making this game because it is
                            something that I have wanted for a long time, and I get to make my dream into an actual
                            product. </p>
